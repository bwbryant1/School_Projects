Steps to completion:
	1) Brute force the hash passwords and then store the passwords
	2) Extract the data from each password protected zip file using the found passwords
	3) Perform steganalysis using the python console to be sure which RGB channel the message has been stegged on (Guess and Check)
	4) Using the Image module from PIL open the image
	5) Split the RGB channels into three different variables: Red,Green,Blue (this breaks the tuple into a one-D array)
	6) AND each pixel with 1 to perform LSB extraction.
	7) Pair each eight bytes and convert it into a char and print out the results
